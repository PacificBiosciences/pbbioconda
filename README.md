## Information
PacBio® tools distributed via [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) are: pre-release versions, **not necessarily ISO compliant**, intended for Research Use Only and not for use in diagnostic procedures, intended only for command-line users, and possibly newer than the currently available SMRT® Analysis builds. While efforts have been made to ensure that releases on Bioconda live up to the quality that PacBio strives for, we make no warranty regarding any Bioconda release.

## Support
As PacBio tools distributed via Bioconda are not covered by any service level agreement or the like, please *do not* contact a PacBio Field Applications Scientist or PacBio Customer Service for assistance with any Bioconda release. We instead provide an issue tracker for you to report issues to us at: https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda. We make no warranty that any such issue will be addressed, to any extent or within any time frame.

Official tech support is only provided for official and stable
[SMRT Link releases](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/analytical-software/)
provided by PacBio.

No support via mail to developers.

For issues with the installation of **conda** or adding the **bioconda** channel,
please refer to the [official bioconda website](https://bioconda.github.io/).

For issues with installed **PacBio binaries through bioconda**, please [create
a new issue](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)!
Our developers will triage your problems internally and reply as soon as possible.

## Installation
Information how to install `conda` and add the `bioconda` channel is
available on https://bioconda.github.io/. Please verify that you have set up conda channel priorities according to https://bioconda.github.io/#set-up-channels. We **strongly recommend you use Miniconda with the Python 2.7** backend, as PacBio packages are not Python 3 compatible yet.

Packages can be installed using following command:
```sh
> conda install -c bioconda package_name
```

Packages can be updated with:
```sh
> conda update package_name
```

In general, because conda only performs the smallest set of updates in order to satisfy the dependency graph, it is **strongly advised** to always update the environment as a whole afterwards:
```sh
> conda update --all
```
In order to avoid stale dependencies in the dependency graph.

## Availability

**Notes:**
* **Python packages require version 2.7; Python 3 is currently not supported! You cannot install PacBio packages alongside python 3-only packages in the same environment!** In order to use python 3-only packages, create a separate conda env.
* BAM refers to the PacBio BAM format that includes additional
per-record or per-ZMW information
* Packages might conflict with other bioconda packages not maintained by PacBio

## FAQ

### Where do I get support?
PacBio tools distributed via bioconda are not covered by any service level
agreement or the like. As such, please *do not* contact a PacBio Field
Applications Scientist or PacBio Customer Service for assistance with any
bioconda releases. We instead provide an
[issue tracker](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda/issues)
for you to report issues.

### I can't find tool X, when will it be available on bioconda?
We do not provide ETAs for currently not available tools.

### When will a new version of tool X be available?
We do not provide ETAs for our release schedule.

### Will SMRT Link be available on bioconda?
There are no plans. For the latest SMRT Link release, please refer to
currently available [SMRT Link downloads](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/analytical-software/).

### Can I get the exact version of the binaries from SMRT Link version XY through bioconda?
There is no effort to keep official [SMRT Link releases](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/analytical-software/)
and bioconda binaries in sync.

### Which version of tool X shall I use, from bioconda or from SMRT Link?
If you need ISO-compliant software that has been fully vetted, you must use our
official [SMRT Link software](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/analytical-software/).
Bioconda binaries are pre-release versions that adhere to high standards,
but might generate slightly different output, due to bug fixes and/or new features.

### Why is the official SMRT Tools Guide not in sync with bioconda binaries?
Official documentation provided by PacBio is for binaries distributed in stable
[SMRT Link releases](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/analytical-software/).
You can click on package names in the table above to get to unofficial,
best effort documentation. Combo- and meta-packages don't necessarily have
additional documentation, as they serve as lightweight, yet well-tested, sets
of existing packages.

### Which operating systems are supported?
All packages are available for **64-bit linux**. Some are available for **64-bit MacOS**.
For details, please study the [table above](#available-packages).
There are no plans to provide darwin binaries for packages currently missing MacOS.
There are no plans to provide executables for Windows.
We do not provide support for WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
